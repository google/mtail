`mtail` is a tool for extracting metrics from application logs to be exported
into a time series database or time series calculator for alerting and
dashboarding.

It aims to fill a niche between applications that do not export their own
internal state, and existing monitoring systems, without patching those
applications or rewriting the same framework for custom extraction glue code.

The extraction is controlled
by [mtail programs](https://github.com/google/mtail/wiki/Programming-Guide)
which define patterns and actions:

    # simple line counter
    counter line_count
    /$/ {
      line_count++
    }

Metrics are exported for scraping by a collector as JSON or Prometheus format
over HTTP, or can be periodically sent to a collected, StatsD, or Graphite
collector socket.

See [the Wiki](https://github.com/google/mtail/wiki/Home) for more details.

### Installation

`mtail` uses a Makefile.  To build `mtail`, type `make` at the command line.
See the [Build instructions](https://github.com/google/mtail/wiki/Building) for
more details.

### Deployment

`mtail` works best when paired with a time series-based calculator and alerting
tool, like [Prometheus](http://prometheus.io).
