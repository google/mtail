refactor fs and notify into single interface

no trailing newline in parser test, requires changes to expr stmt

parse tree/ast testing? - expected AST as result from parse/check instead of
    merely getting a result

mapping between progs and logs to reduce wasted processing

bytecode like
[{push 1} {push 0} {cmp 1} {jm 6} {push 0} {jmp 7} {push 1} {jnm 13}
    {setmatched false} {mload 0} {dload 0} {inc <nil>} {setmatched true}]
can be expressed as
[{push 1} {push 0} {cmp 1} {jm 9} {setmatched false} {mload 0} {dload 0} {inc
    <nil>} {setmatched true}]
but jnm 13 is from the condExpr and the previous is from a comparison binary
    expr; an optimizer is needed to collapse the bytecode to undersand that
    cmp, jm, push, jump, push, jnm in sequence like so is the same as a cmp, jm
and we need to worry about the jump table too


count stack size and preallocate stack
-> counts of push/pop per instruction
-> test to keep p/p counts updated
: seems like a lot of work for not much return


Run and upload benchmarks to https://perfdata.golang.org/ from circleci

GC in the tailer to remove handles on files that haven't been updated in 24h,
    when log files rotate with a timestamp-like pattern


Add coverage from regtest
- perhaps with https://blog.cloudflare.com/go-coverage-with-external-tests/
- or just a flag to mtail?

# Won't do

X Use capture group references to feed back to declaring regular expression,
X     noting unused caprefs,
X     possibly flipping back to noncapturing (and renumbering the caprefs?)
        X -> unlikely to implement, probably won't impact regexp speed

When using a const by itself as a match condition, then we get warnings about
    the capture group names not existing.
    const A /(?<a>.*)/
    A {
      x[$a]++
    }
    ... => $a not defined in scope.


Can't define string constants, like const STRPTIME_FORMAT "Jan _2"

Multline const can't startwith a newline, must be const FOO // +\n...

Can't chain two matches in same expresison like getfilename() =~ 'name' &&
    EXPR_RE because $0 is redefined
